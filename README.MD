# Squad Info Server

#### About

This program is meant to work as a tiny web API, middleman to retrieve game data about a [Squad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/393380/Squad/) dedicated server, without exposing sensitive secrets such as RCON connection details.

This became necessary as of Squad update 6.0 with the introduction of the EOS(Epic Online Services), which broke direct Steam Query requests for Squad game servers.

#### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v20.x) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Installation
* Download the info-server source code.
* Install the dependencies by running <code>npm install </code>
* Configure the <code>config.json</code>

```
WebServerPort: The inbound port for the http requests
rconIP: The IP to connect to RCON on the Squad game server.
rconPort: The Port to connect to RCON on the Squad Game Server
rconPassword: The password used to connect to RCON on the Squad Game Server
updateIntervalSeconds: How often the web server will query the Squad Game Server for data. 
```

* To run, open your terminal and run: <code>node index.js</code>
